### Technical Implementation
#### AWS S3 was the most challenging portion of this project. I wanted a way for users to upload one or more pictures at the same time. I also wanted the first image added to be considered the 'display image'. To figure out how to upload multiple images and use AWS, I console logged and printed almost everything to debug and made changes a long the way.

```
        const formData = new FormData();

        formData.append('image[]', previewImage);
        formData.append(`is_preview_0`, true);

        selectedImages.forEach(img => {
          formData.append('image[]', img);
        });

        // console.log(formData)

        const res = await fetch(`/api/images/${productId}`, {
            method: "POST",
            body: formData,
        });

        if (res.ok) {
            await res.json();
            history.push(`/products/${productId}`)
        };
    };

    const handleImageChange = (e) => {
        const files = Array.from(e.target.files);

        if (files.length > 5) {
            alert("Please select up to 5 files only.");
            return;
        };

        setselectedImages(files.slice(1))
        setPreviewImage(files[0]);
    }
    ```
